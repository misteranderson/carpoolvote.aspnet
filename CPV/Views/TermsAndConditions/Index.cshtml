<h4>TERMS OF SERVICE</h4>

<strong>October 23, 2016</strong>
<p>
THIS FOLLOWING USER AGREEMENT DESCRIBES THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ON WHICH CARPOOL VOTE OFFERS YOU ACCESS TO THE CARPOOL VOTE AND SOULS 2 THE POLLS PLATFORMS.
</p>

<p>
These terms of service constitute a legally binding agreement (the “Agreement”) between you (“you” or “your”) and Carpool Vote (“we,” “us” or “our”), an international open-source project, governing your use of the Carpool Vote website and technology platform and services (collectively, the “Carpool Vote Platform”).
</p>

<p>
The Carpool Vote Platform provides a digital conduit where persons who seek transportation to certain destinations (“Riders”) can be matched with persons driving to or through those destinations (“Drivers”). Drivers and Riders are collectively referred to herein as “Users” and each User shall complete a signup form that enables such User to access the Carpool Vote Platform. For purposes of this Agreement, the driving services provided by Drivers to Riders that are matched through the Platform shall be referred to collectively as the “Services”.
Carpool Vote DOES NOT PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES, AND Carpool Vote IS NOT A TRANSPORTATION CARRIER. IT IS UP TO THE DRIVER TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO OFFER A RIDE TO A RIDER CONTACTED THROUGH THE CARPOOL VOTE PLATFORM, AND IT IS UP TO THE RIDER TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO ACCEPT A RIDE FROM ANY DRIVER CONTACTED THROUGH THE CARPOOL VOTE PLATFORM. ANY DECISION BY A USER TO OFFER OR ACCEPT SERVICES ONCE SUCH USER IS MATCHED THROUGH THE CARPOOL VOTE PLATFORM IS A DECISION MADE IN SUCH USER’S SOLE DISCRETION. EACH TRANSPORTATION SERVICE PROVIDED BY A DRIVER TO A RIDER SHALL CONSTITUTE A SEPARATE AGREEMENT BETWEEN SUCH PERSONS.
By creating your User account and using the Carpool Vote Platform, you expressly acknowledge that you understand this Agreement and accept all of its terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE CARPOOL VOTE PLATFORM OR THE SERVICES.
</p>

Modification to the Agreement
We reserve the right to modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement at any time, effective upon posting the amended terms on this site. If we make changes, we will notify you by, at a minimum, revising the “Last Updated” date at the top of this Agreement. You are responsible for regularly reviewing this Agreement. Continued use of the Carpool Vote Platform or Services after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. If you do not agree to any such changes you may not use or access the Carpool Vote Platform or the Services.
</p>

<h4>How We Use Demographic Data</h4>
<p>
We may review all demographic Data. We may use public information to enable other users to search Your profile, to determine whether Your trip details fit other user's requirements, and to communicate with You. We may use demographic information to tailor the Carpool Vote Platform and communications to Your interests. We may also share demographic information with advertisers on an anonymous and aggregated basis (i.e., without telling the advertisers Your identity). One of the reasons We may do this is to increase the likelihood that Our advertisers' goods and services will appeal to You as a user of the Carpool Vote Platform. Our sharing of demographic information with advertisers is anonymous (i.e., We do not tell advertisers which particular Carpool Vote Users are members of which demographic groups), subject to the rest of this privacy policy. When You respond to an advertisement, however, We ask You to remember that if that ad that is targeted to a demographic group and You decide to give the advertiser Your personal information, then the advertiser may be able to identify You as being a member of that demographic group.
</p>

<h4>Choice/Opt-Out</h4>
<p>
Carpool Vote provides Users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from Us and Our partners at the point where We request information about the visitor. Carpool Vote gives Users the option to remove their information from Our database, to not receive future communications or to no longer receive Our service.
<p>

<h4>Special Cases in Which We Share Personal Information</h4>
<p>
Your personal information may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets, or a bankruptcy. We may also disclose personal information when We determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable law, to cooperate with law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of Carpool Vote or other visitors to the Carpool Vote Platform. We also may disclose Your personal information to Our subsidiary and parent companies and businesses, and other affiliated legal entities and businesses with whom We are under common corporate control. Whenever personal information is disclosed under this paragraph, We may also disclose Your demographic information along with it, on a non-anonymous basis. All of Our parent, subsidiary and affiliated legal entities and businesses that receive Your personal information or non-anonymous demographic information from Us will comply with the terms of this privacy policy with respect to their use and disclosure of such information.
